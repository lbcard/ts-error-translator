This is because you are trying to delete the property of a type that is declared as a required property in the interface.

For example:

```ts
export interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

const myPerson: Person = {
  name: 'Law',
  age: 34
};

delete myPerson.age;
```

This causes the error 2790 as age is required by the Person interface.

You can either use a partial type:

```ts
const myPerson: Partial<Person> = {
  name: 'Law',
  age: 34
};

delete myPerson.age;
```

or adjust the interface so that the property is optional:

```ts
export interface Person {
  name: string;
  age?: number;
}

const myPerson: Person = {
  name: 'Law',
  age: 34
};

delete myPerson.age;
```
